totalDistance = uphillDistance + downhillDistance    # position 1 or 2, we have to define total distance before calculations
totalTime = uphillTime + downhillTime                # position 1 or 2, we have to define total time before calculations
averageSpeed = totalDistance / totalTime             # position 3, now we are doing calculations with the totals we just defined
print(averageSpeed)                                  # position 4, The output goes last
