populationIn2012 = 1000
populationIn2013 = populationIn2012 * 1.1
populationIn2014 = populationIn2013 * 1.1
populationIn2015 = populationIn2014 * 1.1

# Change all the 0.1 multipliers to 1.1
# Using 0.1 would tell us the increase amount, but we also need to multiply by 1 to include the original population
