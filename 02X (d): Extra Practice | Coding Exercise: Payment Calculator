print(min(balance,max(10,balance*0.021)))

# The first part of this quesion is determining what is lower the balance or the calculation for the minimum payment
# min(balance, ?)
# Next is determining what that minimum payment would be $10 or 2.1% of the balance, which ever is greater
# 2.1% of the balance would be *0.021
# max(10,balance*0.021)
# now we can plug this in to our previous equaiton where we left the question mark
# min(balance,max(10,balance*0.021))
