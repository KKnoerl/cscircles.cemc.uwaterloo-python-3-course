# Question: Find the last character of string S

S[len(S)-1]

# Think of the index as a stopping point inbetween characters, and the character after gets read.
# index 0 is the starting position before the first character, so S[0] is the first character
# len() will find the end position after the last character, but there's no character after the end, we want one less, so S[len(S)-1] is the last character
# In other words, the start of the range in inclusive, the end range is exclusive
