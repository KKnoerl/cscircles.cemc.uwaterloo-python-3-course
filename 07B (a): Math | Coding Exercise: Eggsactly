eggs = int(input())  # set the variable as int from the input()
print(eggs//12)      # to get the exact number of cartons without the decimal we want integer division with \\
print(eggs%12)       # to get the remainder of eggs we use the modulus operator %

# eggs//12 is the same as doing int(eggs/12)
