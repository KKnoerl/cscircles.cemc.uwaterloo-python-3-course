   if a**2 < n:       # set our condition. here we want squares of variable a that are less than n
      print(a**2)     # set result when if is true, we want the squares of a to print
                      # now the program will loop back, a will move to the next number in the range, and we go to line 3 again, this will repeat until the end of our range n
