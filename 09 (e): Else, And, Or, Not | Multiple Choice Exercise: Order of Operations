# Question: What is the value of: A or not B and C
# when (A,B,C) is (False,True,True)

# think of and, or. not as and(), or(), not()
# The equation becomes:
# A or (not (B and C))     # or if you like excel =OR(A,(NOT(AND(B,C))))
# working inside the parentheses out
# (B and C) = (True and True) = (True)
# then we have to solve not(), not(True) = False
# then we have A or (False) which becomes, False or (False) = False
