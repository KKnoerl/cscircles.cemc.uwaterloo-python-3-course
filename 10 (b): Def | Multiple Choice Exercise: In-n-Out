# Question: What is the output of the following program?

def f():          # function of 0 arguments     # We define function f with no arguments (no input())
   print("in f")                                # When called, this function will print "in f"
print("not in f")                               # print will now output the quoted text "not in f" this is our first output line
f()               # call f now                  # now function f is called, function f is defined to print "in f" this is our second output line

# Answer:
# line 1: not in f
# line 2: in f
