# Question: The output of print(type(print(type(type(print(print())))))) consists of 4 lines. Put them in the correct order.

# This line has 4 lines of output because there are 4 print arguments, lets work through them from the center outward
# i will use ^ to mean the above arguments

# print()   # an empty print will return an empty line, this is our output for Line 1: <<blank line>>
# print(^)  # print() is used, creating an empty refrence that will return the placeholder None, this is our output for line 2: None
# type(^)   # The type for None is <class 'NoneType'> but there is no output on this step
# type(^)   # The type of a type is <class 'type'> but there is no output on this step
# print(^)  # we print the above result which was <class 'type'> this is the output for line 3: <class 'type'>
# type(^)   # print() is used, creating an empty refrence that will return the placeholder None, the type for this is <class 'NoneType'>, no output on this step
# print(^)  # we print the above result which was <class 'NoneType'> this is the output for line 4: <class 'NoneType'>

# Answer:
# <<blank line>>
# None
# <class 'type'>
# <class 'NoneType'>
