# Question: What is the value of x that will cause mystery(x) to run forever?

def mystery(x):
  a = [0, 4, 0, 3, 2]
  while x > 0:          # x needs to be greater than 0 to continue through the loop
    x = a[x]            # so we either need a value where x is equal to the number in the [x] position, or that would loop back on itself
  return "Done"

# Answer: 3             # 3 is in the [3] position so this will reassign x from 3 to 3, and always > 0, so it loops forever
