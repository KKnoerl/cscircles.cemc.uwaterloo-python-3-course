# Question: What is the output of the following code fragment?

stuff = [2, 25, 80, 12]       # This establishes a list named 'stuff' that has 4 values in places 0 to 3
stuff[stuff[0]] = stuff[3]    # Stuff[0] resolves to the first item in the list "2", stuff[stuff[0]] then resolves to stuff["2"] which is "80", that is set to equal stuff[3] which is "12", so "80" is reassigned to "12"
print(stuff)                  # now we print the list, the only change we made was to reassign stuff[2] from "80" to "12", that leaves us with [2, 25, 12, 12]

# Answer: [2, 25, 12, 12]
