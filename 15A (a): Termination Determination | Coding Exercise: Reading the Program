# This is a tricky problem because they don't tell you how to expect the input, or how they expect the output.
# the entire line will input at once
# the output should be a return of a list, where each list item is a line from input

def getBASIC():                 # first we define our function "getBASIC" with zero arguments ()
   List = []                    # now we create an empty List []
   while True:                  # create an open while loop

      List.append(S)            # add that string to our list
      if S.endswith("END"):     # if that string endswith "END"
         break                  # then we break out of the while loop
