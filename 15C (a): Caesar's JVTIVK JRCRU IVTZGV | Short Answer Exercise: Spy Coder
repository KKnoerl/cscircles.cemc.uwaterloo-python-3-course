# Question: What is the result of encrypting SPY CODER with the shift value S=5?
# Answer: XUD HTIJW
                                                      # creating a plan for later
# to solve this convert the letters to numbers        # we could use a for loop to run through each letter
# 19,16,25 3,15,4,5,18                                # we could convert letters to ord()
# add 5 to each number                                # we can add 5 to the ord(), for ord()s in the letters range
# 24,21,30 8,20,9,10,23
# subtract 26 from any number over 26                 # we could create an if statement to check > ord('Z')
# 30 - 26 = 4                                         # when true we can subtract ord('Z')
# 24,21,4 8,20,9,10,23
# and finally convert back to letters                 # then we can convert back to char()
# XUD HTIJW                                           # and build a string from there
