# Question: If the encrypted message is HUD, and the shift value is S=6, what was the original message?
# Answer: BOX
                                                      # creating a plan for later
# to solve this convert the letters to numbers        # we could use a for loop to run through each letter
# 8,21,4                                              # we could convert letters to ord()
# subtract 6 from each number                         # we can subtract 6 from the ord(), for ord()s in the letters range
# 2,15,-2
# add 26 to any number less than 26                   # we could create an if statement to check < ord('A')
# -2 + 26 = 24                                        # when true we can add ord('Z')
# 2,15,24
# and finally convert back to letters                 # then we can convert back to char()
# BOX                                                 # and build a string from there
