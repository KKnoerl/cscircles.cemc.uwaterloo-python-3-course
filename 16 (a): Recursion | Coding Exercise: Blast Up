# to visualize this, lets say n = 3

# in the original function we have countup(3)
# if n == 0, it is not, so we continue
# now we countup(n-1)
# in this first recursion n = 2 (3-1)
# if n == 0, it is not, so we continue
# now we countup(n-1)
# in this second recursion n = 1 (2-1)
# if n == 0, it is not so we continue
# now we countup(n-1)
# in this third recursion n = 0 (1-1)
# if n == 0, YES, so "Blastoff!" gets output, return None mean we don't have a value to carry thorugh
# back to the second recursion: line 5 is solved and we can now go to line 6
#   print n, in this recursion n was 1, so now the output is "1"
# back to the first recursion: line 5 is solved and we can now go to line 6
#   print n, in this recursion n was 2, so now the output is "2"
# back to the original function: line 5 is solved and now we can go to line 6
#   print n, in this function n was 3, so now the output is "3"
# now we are finished witht this function
