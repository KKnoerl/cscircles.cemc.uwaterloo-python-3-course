# Question: Unscramble the lines to create a program that produces a recursive ruler-like design.
# Answer:

def ruler(n):         # first we define the funtion "ruler" to take one argument "n"
  if n == 1:          # when n is 1
    print('-')        # then print "-"
  else:               # when n is not 1
    ruler(n - 1)      # create a recursion with n - 1 (this recursion brings n down to 1 for the first '-')(when we come out of this recursion n will be one greater each time, building up to the full n height)
    print(n * '-')    # then print '-' the length of n (this grows the pattern, when we had n-1, just n is one greater so a line is added
    ruler(n - 1)      # create another recursion with n - 1 (this brings n back down 1 at a time, and creats 1 less '-' )
