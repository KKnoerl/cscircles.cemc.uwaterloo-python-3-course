max(x - 3, min(x + 10, x + 5))

# Question: What is the simplification of the following expression?
# Answer: x + 5

# We can read this as "What's larger, x-3 or min(x + 10, x + 5) ?
# first lets see what the min comes out to: something with +5 is going to be smaller than with +10
# so now we can answer what is larger x-3 or x+5 ? a number with +5 will be larger than with -3
