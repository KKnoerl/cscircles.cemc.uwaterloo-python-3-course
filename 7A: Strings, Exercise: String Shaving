S=input()             # first we get the string from the input
print(S[1:len(S)-1])  # then we decide where our stopping points are. 

# S[0] is the stopping point before the first letter, but we want to exclude that first letter, so add 1 and we get S[1]
# then we want to end our range before the last letter, but len(S) finds the position after the last letter, so we want 1 less and we get S[len(S)-1]
# put both of these in the S range to create the substring S[1:len(S)-1]

# note: If you get the error: "TypeError: String indices must be integers make sure you are using a colon : to seperate the range and not a comma ,
