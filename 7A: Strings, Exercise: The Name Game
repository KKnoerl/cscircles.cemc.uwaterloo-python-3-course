print(name + ", " + name + ", bo-b" + name[1:len(name)])  # print the name and concatenate with the spacing and punctuation and bo-b, and the name without the first letter: name[1:len(name)}

# This one looks scary becuase we have a lot to output, but it's not so bad, just printing lots of plain quoted text, a name, and a name without the first letter
# alternatively on line 2 you could use *2 instead of repeating the "name, " # print((name + ", ")*2 + "bo-b" + name[1:len(name)])
