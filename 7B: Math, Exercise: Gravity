import math                                       # we need to import the math module before we can use math.sqrt()
v = float(input())                                # assign your variable as a float value from input()
print((v-math.sqrt(v**2-4*-4.9*11000))/(2*-4.9))  # set up your equation. the parentheses are mostly the same as the given equation, but add parentheses for the top and bottom halves of the fraction

# a walk through to typing your equation:
# print has it's own set of parentheses
# we need another set of parentheses for the top half of the fraction
# v-math.sqrt() does not need additional parentheses because - is the only operation
# math.sqrt has it's own parentheses
# v**2-4*-4.9*11000 does not need parentheses because PEMDAS is the correct order. v**2 will happen first, then the multiplications, then the subtraction last
# note: we should be careful about negative numbers and subtraction because they both use the same - symbol. when in doubt more parentheses don't hurt
# we need another set of parentheses for the bottom half of the fraction
# 2*-4.9 does not need parentheses because * is the only operation
# note: we should be careful about negative numbers and subtraction because they both use the same - symbol. when in doubt more parentheses don't hurt
